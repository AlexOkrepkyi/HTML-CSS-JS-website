# HTML-CSS-JS-website
Absolutely naive reminiscence from 2016 in form of a website that has not been finished due to lack of free time:)
Unfortunately, only basic html+css+js version survived those years, meaning that alpha version with Python+Django back-end has been successfully lost somewhere in Narnia, likely.

It had to be a landpage for a great artist that produces crafts from the natural clay. 

Anyway, though this version of the website is obscure, artist is still great, you may check her products via Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/lisovaceramica/
